        <h4 class="icone2">PARATY, RIO DE JANEIRO - BRASIL</h4>
        
        <p>Along with the ocean, between two rivers, Paraty is settled at an average height of only five meters. For being almost at sea level, the city was designed taking in account the flow of sea waters. As a result, many of its streets are periodically flooded by the high tide- what gave the town the title of “Brazilian Venice”.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1667, the town was, during the Brazilian Colonial Period (1530-1815) the most important exporting seaport for gold from Brazil toits metropolis, Portugal. Up to these days, the city keeps in its historical downtown the characteristic architecture from that period - the old houses have been reclassified as inns, restaurants, local craft-work stores and museums. Tourists from the entire world walk through the streets, made of irregular stones. Attracted by the beauty of the typical  architecture from the Colonial Brazil - and, of course, by the beaches.</p>
        <p>The beaches are an extra attraction: there are more than 58 - some of those, only accessible by boat, due to the savage nature conservation. The calm and clear waters are perfect for diving and scuba diving, which attracts a big number of practitioners.</p>
        <p>For people who prefer fresh to salty water, Paraty also offers ten waterfalls, some of them really near the downtown area.</p>

        <h4 class="icone2">JEWC CITY</h4>

        <p>Able to receive a record number of participants and to allow mobility of them inside the event, the JEWC CIty has been created. For the first time in the history of the Junior Enterprise Network a city will host the discussions, exchanges and it will provide a whole new experience to the participants.</p>

        <p>The city and its registered establishments will welcome the JEWC participants, allowing them to have a greater possibility of choice and interaction with Paraty and the JEWC CIty</p>

        <p>Divided into 3 areas, JEWC City will offer the participant the possibility to explore and adapt the city in his own “style” - cult, connected or party rocker. Each area has its own caracteristics and they’re all able to host the participants and stimulate the JEWC spirit.</p>
