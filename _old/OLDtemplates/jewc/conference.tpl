    <h1 class="icone">The Conference</h1>
    
    <p>EVOLVE. In 2004, Brazil hosted the first edition of the JEWC in Fortaleza. In 2006, it was Netherland’s time to be JEWCed. In 2008, another edition went down in Portugal and the last one, in 2010, took place in Milan. Now, in 2012, JEWC comes back to Brazil. To tell its the “biggest event of the world” is a big deal and brings great responsability as well. That’s why we mean it: the Junior Enterprise World Conference 2012 will be the Biggest Event of the Junior Enterprise Network! Deconstruct concepts, break paradigms, that’s our great challenge.</p>

    <p>UNDERTAKE. Asia, Africa, South America, Europe. The Junior Enterprise Network is as wide as its enriching cultures. Over 2,100 participants are expected in the JEWC 2012 and they’ll come from all over the world. To undertake is also to exchange and that’s what the event seeks to encourage. Searching tools to change. No wonder why a few hotels didn’t suffice: we needed to transform Paraty into the JEWC City.</p>
    
    <p>TRANSFORM. The biggest event of the world, in the country with the largest number of junior enterprises and a whole city ready to host it. Everything’s great and we’re not surprised to say so: each junior entrepreneur is great in his own nature and that reflects in the greatness of the network. A toast to that! Transform in the JEWC 2012 won’t demand great efforts, after all.</p>
